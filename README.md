# Snake-Game-AI

We first Create a Virtual Environment and install the following 
1. Python == 3.11.5
2. Pytorch ( run command - pip3 install torch torchvision )
3. Pygame (run command - pip install pygame )
4. Matplotlib and ipython ( run command - pip install matplotlib ipython )

We achieved an average score of about 8 in 100 iterations, and the highest score was 50.
We used the Q learning approach here.
